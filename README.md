## project 1
We aim to predict the heating load of a house given a number of features via linear regression. To begin,
we investigate the connections between each feature and the label in physics. We also generate a graph
to visualize the relationships with the help of class examples which help us discard some features. Then
we add some useful features by operating on different features according to their physical meaning and
abandon some duplicated or redundant features. Finally, we train with a number of regression models
and compare the evaluation results of each via cross validation to select the final model. The following
approaches we describe yield approximately 0.47413 error on the testing set.
## project 2
We aim to recognize (from 10 possible classes) the type of clothing in a 28 Ã— 28 black and white
image from the fashion mnist data set. To do this, we utilize neural networks. We investigate the
performance of multiple network architectures and the effects of changing their many hyperparameters.
After training on the provided training set, the best-performing network architecture that we discovered
yields an accuracy of approximately 0.9264 on the provided testing set.
